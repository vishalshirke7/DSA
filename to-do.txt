Reverse a stack without using any external data structure. Initially, I had no idea how to solve this problem. But the interviewer helped me by giving some hints and finally I was able to solve it.
Find the merging point of two linked lists. I was told that no hints would be provided by the interviewer, but I knew the problem and I solved it quite easily.


In an array of elements ( 1 <= a[i] <= n ), one element will be repeated. Find both the repeating and the missing elements.
In an array of elements ( 1 <= a[i] <= n ) find the frequency of occurrence of numbers 1 to n without using any extra space (not even a hashmap). I was about to quit this question, the interviewer gave me a hint and then I was able to solve it. He was telling me that I have missed an edge case, I didn’t get what was that edge case and he moved to the next question.
Given a binary tree, for each node in the tree, replace the node value with the sum of its children subtrees.

Problem - Get top K searches in e-commerce 
K = 10

K = 3
Min-Heap 'z': 2
    'v' 2
'a'2     'b'3
 
'vsihal': 10
'vsihal': 9
'vsihal': 1

1. Inserting a new search in Database/heap
    - store in a persistent layer
    1. heap < k
    2. heap == k

Orchestartor - input_search_query - a
2. Write - 
[a-Z]


Clusters

7 8 9

1. Global Cache 


1. Parallel Machines
2. Load Balancing

1. traffic to one server 
2. Server down
3. Heap is segregated - Retrieval
