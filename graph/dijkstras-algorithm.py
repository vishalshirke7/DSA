Provided that all of the vertices are reachable from the source vertex; 
Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm can be used to find the shortest distance from the source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. 
The graph can be directed or undirected, cyclic or acyclic, but the weights on all edges need to be nonnegative.
