BFS — when we want to find the shortest path from a particular source node to a specific destination. 
	(Or more generally, the smallest number of steps to reach the end state from a given initial state.)

DFS — when we want to exhaust all possibilities and check which one is the best/count the number of all possible ways.
		either BFS or DFS — when we just want to check connectedness between two nodes on a given graph. (Or more generally, 
		whether we could reach a given state to another.)
